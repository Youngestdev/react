# My first react app

### My Sugar lab task.

To view this project you have to do the following

Clone the repository

Use git to clone it or better still download the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/Youngestdev/react-app.git
```
Its a large file.. i didn't transform it into production size.. I don't think thats necessary..

## Starting the app

Firstly, navigate into the react-app folder .. cd /react-app. start the app by running npm start in your terminal.. and view the page at localhost:3000 You should get a warm screen like this ..

Edit the contents between the div class. You can add anything .. Headers, images , etc.
